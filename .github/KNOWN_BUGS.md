    Community driven Classless MMO Framework. Proudly

## Why are there still known Bugs?

Since we (the team) at AstoriaCore do not continue to develop this source, we have not worked on 
these bugs yet, and will not for now. We have paused work on the project for a reason.

`Please Note: These Bugs are ONLY for the AzerothCore Version of AstoriaCore, since we stopped working on this Version of the Core very early in Development, most or all of these Bugs are not there in the TrinityCore Version of the Source!`
